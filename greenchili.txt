This recipe is pretty awesome but Anna complains it is too savage for
her to eat. So there is a "weak" version as a compromise. But the
compromise does not fully satisfy either party.

strong version:
2 jalapenos
5 serranos
weak version:
3 chilacas

in both:
7 anaheim chilis
6 tomatillos
1 onion
1 pound pork loin
1 cube chicken bouillon
1 heaping tsp oregano
1 heaping tsp cumin

Plus you need salt, oil and corn starch.

Chop up the pork and cook with plenty of salt and oil til it's not pink.

Blend all the other stuff.

Cook on low for 2 hours. Duration not too important, you can trade
heat for time with only minor loss of tastiness.

At the end, you need to thicken.

Double check that you are using corn starch, NOT baking soda.

Then take about 2 spoons of corn starch and mix in a bit of the chili. Keep
mixing in a bit of chili until it seems to be approximately the same
temperature as the chili. Then mix it into the main chili itself. This
is necessary because the corn starch needs to heat up slowly.
