Fish tacos are pretty simple. They are good for experimentation, too, since
you can make your standard fish tacos plus one new ingredient and people
can mix and match.

There are two sorts of fish tacos. Fried, or grilled. In general fried is
tastier, but grilled is healthier and easier. These are grilled.

Ingredients for six tacos:

6 tortillas
3/4 pound fish
salsa
limeslaw
sour cream

* Tortillas

The best tortillas I have found are the "sonora style" corn tortillas
in Berkeley Bowl. Overall, you definitely want corn tortillas. Flour
tortillas are impossible to screw up, but worse. So they are like
training wheels. The key to corn tortillas is, do not just eat the cheap
corn tortillas straight out of the container. You need to heat them up
on the grill. You want to heat them enough so that you can see some
brown marks, but not so much that they become stiff.

* Fish

You want a white fish that is stiff enough to hold up to grilling.
And no bones because that's annoying.
My ranking is
1. swordfish
2. halibut

* Salsa

You don't really want a salsa with lots of chunks of things in it, because
the "providing crunch" role is taken by the limeslaw. The best is
Papalote salsa, which you can get at Whole Foods.

* Limeslaw

See limeslaw.txt. I am not sure how much slaw is needed, it seems to
vary a lot by taste.

* Sour cream

Don't skip this step thinking it won't make a difference.

You don't need to do any fancy marination, just cook the fish on the
grill, and heat up the tacos a bit.
