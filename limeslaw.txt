This is like coleslaw but not creamy or anything, just limey.

4 cups of cabbage (1/3 to 1/2 a head)
2 tbs olive oil
1 lime
1/4 cup cilantro
salt
pepper

Chop the cabbage as thinly as you have the energy to.

Get as much zest and juice out of the lime as possible. Mix up the
lime and oil, then mix it into the cabbage. Then mix in the cilantro.

The trickiest part is seasoning. A heaping 1/4 tsp salt is about the
right amount. Not too much pepper, just sort of lightly dust, then toss.

Then leave it sit for half an hour to let the other parts soak up
liminess.

You should be able to eat a little bit straight up and immediately get
that "snacky" desire to eat a more of it. If not, the two likely
problems are insufficiently good cabbage, or not enough salt.

This feeds two people who are in the mood to eat a good amount of
limeslaw.
