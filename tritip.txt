This recipe is for a tri-tip of 1.5-2.5 pounds.

Rub:
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon black pepper
1 tablespoon salt

Trim the fat off basically as much as you can before putting rub on. Leave the rubbed tri-tip in the fridge for a while. I usually prep at lunch and leave it for a few hours.

The cooking technique is the "reverse sear." In phase one, bake at 300 using a tray with a rack on it. About 40 minutes, temp with meat thermometer should hit 120-125.

Rest for 15 minutes. Dry with paper towels.

Put 2 tablespoons of ghee in a cast iron pan. Open doors and turn on vents to max to avoid smoke alarms. Heat on high til it's really hot, then sear 2 minutes each side.

Slice against the grain.
