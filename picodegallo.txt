Pico de gallo is great.

Enough for 2 adults and 2 little kids:

2 tomatoes
1/2 a white onion
3-ish jalapeños
Half a thing of cilantro
Limes maybe

Chop, mix. Put a little bit of salt on it.

That much is pretty simple. There was this pico de gallo at Taquería Huentitan in Chicago that was spicy, but I'm not sure how.
It felt less like a deep vegetabley chili pepper, and more like an airy light but hot spice.
It also had these little seeds that looked like sesame seeds but were pointy.
Maybe those seeds were from some dried or mashed peppers?
TODO: try chiles de arbol
